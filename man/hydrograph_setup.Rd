\title{Hydrograph Setup for RFA Simulation}
\usage{
hydrograph_setup(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Data frame representing an input hydrograph with columns: Ord, Date, Time, Flow (cfs).
Copied directly from RMC-RFA.}
}
\value{
A list of formatted hydrograph data frames, each containing:
\describe{
\item{dt}{Date-time (POSIXct)}
\item{hour}{Hours from start of event}
\item{inflow}{Inflow (cfs)}
\item{hydrograph_num}{Hydrograph ID number for sampling}
}
}
\description{
Prepares hydrograph data frames copied from RMC-RFA for use in RFA simulation.
Converts date/time columns and adds sequential hour and hydrograph ID columns.
}
\examples{
# Setup multiple hydrographs for RFA
# hydros <- hydrograph_setup(hydro_apr1999, hydro_jun1965, hydro_pmf)
}

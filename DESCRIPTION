Description: An R implementation of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) 
    Risk Management Center-Reservoir Frequency Analysis (RMC-RFA) methodology/software. 
    This package produces reservoir stage-frequency curves with uncertainty bounds 
    by combining deterministic flood routing (Modified Puls method) with a nested 
    Monte Carlo framework. The outer loop quantifies knowledge uncertainty in inflow 
    volume frequency distributions, while the inner loop simulates natural variability 
    across thousands of flood events. Uncertain variables include inflow volume, 
    flood hydrograph shape, seasonal occurrence, and antecedent reservoir stage. 
    The resulting stage-frequency curves provide critical hydrologic hazard 
    assessment data for dam safety risk analyses, enabling evaluation of loading 
    parameters (stage, discharge, duration) and their associated annual exceedance 
    probabilities.
